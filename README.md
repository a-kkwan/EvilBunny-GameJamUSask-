# Evil Bunny - Game Jam (University of Saskatchewan, October 2016) 

Personally, this project was my first exposure to game development (using C#, the Unity Game Engine) and software engineering (in terms of group work and working collectively with my senior peers) as I did not have previous experience in game creation. A game created during the bi-annual Game Jam event at the University of Saskatchewan (October 2016) by four students (one second and three third year University of Saskatchewan Computer Science students) within 48 hours. More information about UofS' Game Jam can be found [here](http://gamewithus.ca). 

This game was inspired by Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and entails four levels that increase in difficulty as the player progresses. The player is a rabbit, and the rabbit advances through the maze level attempting to get to the end, while encountering knights along the way. Each time a knight is crossed, a scene from the movie plays for added drama. This addition was intended for entertainment purposes. Information about Evil found is found [here](http://gamewithus.ca/games/?gameID=94).
